# Hello-world-in-java
An advanced hello world program in java, this code shows you how to take users input and display and an output.
Makes newbies to be familiar with both input and output unlike the traditional hello world program that makes use of only output.
I'm doing this chnages so that any user will know how to input or output data to the console in java if he/she understands this code properly.
